# Exercise 7: Template Renderer

**Goal**

Build a `/render` endpoint that accepts two query parameters title and body and renders them into an inline HTML template. The template must be defined inside your Go file as a string constant, parsed with `html/template`, and executed into the ResponseWriter. No external HTML files.
 
**Key Tasks**

●     Define an HTML template as a raw string constant inside your `.go` file:

```html
const tmplStr = `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>{{.Title}}</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>{{.Title}}</h1>
  <p>{{.Body}}</p>
</body>
</html>
`
```
```go
type PageData struct {
	Title string
	Body  string
}
```

 
●     Parse the template using `template.Must(template.New("page").Parse(tmplStr))`.

●     In the `/render` handler read title and body from the query string.

●     If either is missing return 400 with: `"title and body are required"`.

●     Execute the template with `tmpl.Execute(w, PageData{Title: title, Body: body})`.

●     If Execute returns an error return 500 with: `"template execution failed"`.

●     Set the Content-Type header to `text/html` before executing the template.
 
**Critical difference from Exercise 2**

In Exercise 2 you set Content-Type before writing the body. Here you must also
set it before calling `tmpl.Execute()` because Execute writes to w directly.
Once Execute writes its first byte, headers are locked. Set them first.

What is `template.Must()` and when does it panic? Write the answer in a comment.

**Stretch do this after the core task works**

●     Add a third query parameter: style. `If style=bold`, wrap `{{.Body}}` in `<strong>` tags.

○     Hint: you cannot use an if statement in the query param use template conditionals: `{{if eq .Style \"bold\"}}<strong>{{.Body}}</strong>{{else}}{{.Body}}{{end}}`

●     Add a PageData field Style string and pass it through from the query param.
