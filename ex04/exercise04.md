# Exercise 4: Form Decoder

**Goal**

Build a `/form` endpoint that accepts a POST request with a URL-encoded form body containing two fields: `username` and `language`. Parse both, validate them, and return a formatted confirmation. This is the closest exercise in this set to what ascii-art-web actually does.


**Key Tasks**

●     Reject non-POST requests with 405.

●     Call `r.ParseForm()` to parse the incoming form body do not skip this step.

●     Read username and language using `r.FormValue()`.

●     If either field is empty return 400 Bad Request with a message identifying which field is missing.

○     Missing username → `"username is required"`

○     Missing language → `"language is required"`

●     If both are present respond with: `"Hello [username], you are coding in [language]!"`

 
**Think about**

What is the difference between `r.ParseForm()` + `r.Form.Get()` and just `r.FormValue()`?
`r.FormValue()` calls ParseForm internally but calling ParseForm explicitly first
gives you control over error handling. Try it both ways.

**Stretch do this after the core task works**

●     Handle the case where the request Content-Type is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Return a 415 Unsupported Media Type with a clear message.

○     Read Content-Type from `r.Header.Get()` and check it before parsing.

○     Test it: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "username=Ada" http://localhost:8080/form`
