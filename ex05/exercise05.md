# Exercise 5: Status Code Factory

**Goal**

Build a `/status` endpoint that accepts a code query parameter containing any HTTP status code number. The server must respond using that exact status code. This forces you to think about how status codes are set and when they cannot be changed.
 
**Key Tasks**

●     Read the code query parameter using `r.URL.Query().Get("code")`.

●     If code is missing or empty return `400` with the message: `"code parameter is required"`.

●     Convert code to an integer using `strconv.Atoi()`. If conversion fails return `400` with: `"code must be a valid integer"`.

●     If the integer is not between `100` and `599` return `400` with: "code must be a valid HTTP status code `(100–599)`".

●     If the code is valid respond with that exact status code using `w.WriteHeader(code)` and a body message: `"Responding with status [code]"`.

 
**Critical rule**

* You must call `w.WriteHeader(code)` BEFORE writing anything to `w` with `w.Write()`
or `fmt.Fprintf()`. 

* If you write the body first, Go automatically sends a `200` header
and you cannot change it afterwards. 

* The order is: WriteHeader → then Write.

* Test this deliberately: call `w.Write()` first, then `w.WriteHeader(404)`. What does
`curl -v` show you? Write your observation in a comment in your file.

**Stretch do this after the core task works**

●     After calling `w.WriteHeader()`, append a descriptive name to the body message.

○     `?code=404` → "Responding with status 404 Not Found"

○     Use `http.StatusText(code)` to get the official status name.
