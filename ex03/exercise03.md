# Exercise 3: Header Detective

**Goal**

Create a `/headers` endpoint that inspects two specific request headers: X-Custom-Token and Content-Type. The handler reads both, reports what it found, and enforces a rule about one of them.
 
**Key Tasks**

●     Read X-Custom-Token using ``r.Header.Get("X-Custom-Token")``.

●     If X-Custom-Token is missing or empty respond with 400 Bad Request and the message: `"X-Custom-Token header is missing"`.

●     If X-Custom-Token is present respond with a message that includes its value. Example: `"Token received: abc123"`.

●     Also read Content-Type and append it to the response. If it is missing, append `"Content-Type not provided"`.

●     The full response for a valid request must look like this:

○    ` Token received: abc123`

○     `Content-Type: application/json`


**Why this matters**

ascii-art-web reads ``r.Header` indirectly through t`emplate and form handling.
Understanding how headers work and what happens when they are absent prepares you for writing handlers that behave correctly under any input.

**Stretch — do this after the core task works**

●     What does `r.Header.Get()` return for a header key that was never sent? 

Write a one-sentence answer in a comment at the top of your file.

●     Is `r.Header.Get("x-custom-token")` the same as `r.Header.Get("X-Custom-Token")`? Find out.
