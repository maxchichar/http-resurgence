# Exercise 3: Header Detective

**Goal**

Create a `/headers` endpoint that inspects two specific request headers: X-Custom-Token and Content-Type. The handler reads both, reports what it found, and enforces a rule about one of them.
 
**Key Tasks**

●     Read X-Custom-Token using `r.Header.Get("X-Custom-Token")`.
●     If X-Custom-Token is missing or empty respond with 400 Bad Request and the message: `"X-Custom-Token header is missing"`.
●     If X-Custom-Token is present respond with a message that includes its value. Example: `"Token received: abc123"`.
●     Also read Content-Type and append it to the response. If it is missing, append `"Content-Type not provided"`.
●     The full response for a valid request must look like this:
○     Token received: abc123
○     Content-Type: application/json


**Why this matters**

ascii-art-web reads `r.Header` indirectly through template and form handling.
Understanding how headers work and what happens when they are absent prepares you for writing handlers that behave correctly under any input.
