# Exercise 1: The Method Inspector

**Goal**

Build a `/method-inspector` endpoint that reads the HTTP method of every incoming request and echoes it back in a descriptive sentence. No method should be rejected and this handler accepts everything and reports what it sees.
 
**Key Tasks**

●     Register a `/method-inspector` handler using `http.HandleFunc`.

●     Read the request method using `r.Method`.

●     Respond with a plain text message that includes the method name.

>> ○     GET request → "You made a GET request."

>> ○     POST request → "You made a POST request."

>> ○     Any other method → "You made a [METHOD] request."

●     Do not hardcode each method with its own if/else branch use the value of `r.Method` directly in your response string.

**Why this matters**

In ascii-art-web your POST `/ascii-art` handler must distinguish incoming methods
before doing any work. This exercise builds the muscle of reading `r.Method`
cleanly and using it not just checking it.
