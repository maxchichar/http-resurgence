# Exercise 2: The Echo Chamber

**Goal**

Create an `/echo` endpoint that only accepts POST requests. When a client sends a POST with a body, read the entire body and send it straight back. The response must be exactly what was sent nothing added, nothing removed.
 
**Key Tasks**

●     Reject any non-POST request with `http.StatusMethodNotAllowed` (405).

●     Read the full request body using `io.ReadAll(r.Body)`.

●     Always `defer r.Body.Close()` immediately after checking for an error not at the end of the function.

●     If the body is completely empty (zero bytes), return a 400 Bad Request with the message `"body cannot be empty"`.

●     Write the body content back to w exactly as received.


**Think about**

* What does `io.ReadAll` return if the request has no body at all?
* Is `len(body) == 0` the same as `body == nil`? Try both and see.
* What happens to `r.Body` if you read it twice without closing it? 


**Stretch do this after the core task works**

●     Add a response header: `Content-Type: text/plain` before writing the body back.

○     Use `w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain")` and call it before `w.Write()`.

○     What happens if you call `w.Header().Set() after w.Write()`? Try it and explain what you observe.
